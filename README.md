# Hello-World
This is my introductory repository including information about myself and my future projects.

Growing up in a small town in Alaska, there was not much technology surrounding me as I grew up. I found my own tools and made do with what I had. In middle school, I helped out with the high school video production class, and that's when I really gained interest in computing, I went form running a camera to directing them. In high school, I enrolled in a class that gave me the time to learn more about computing, and eventually I began programming. I have made and published two apps, Techulator and Pockey (Primitive apps that taught me the basics of programming). Since then I have worked with a few languages, Objective C, Java, and Visual Basic. 
Currently, I am working on a build of robotic arms for prosthetic purposes. I have done extensive programming for the arduino control board that controls the arms. This has pushed my interest to more extremes, where I now and trying to find new projects to work on.

This is the end to my introduction.
